# best to build up container using kickstart mentality.
# ie, to add more packages to image,
# re-run bootstrap command again.
# bootstrap on existing image will build on top of it, not overwriting it/restarting from scratch
# singularity .def file is like kickstart file
# unix commands can be run, but if there is any error, the bootstrap process ends
%setup
   # commands to be executed on host outside container during bootstrap
%post
    # commands to be executed inside container during bootstrap
    # add python and install some packages
     # install tensorflow
     # create bind points for storage.
     mkdir /extra
     mkdir /xdisk
     exit 0
# %runscript
   # commands to be executed when the container runs
# %test
   # commands to be executed within container at close of bootstrap process
